# Sudoku-Solver

Utilizing a recursive guess-and-check strategy, consistency checker, and constant propagation I have a program that can solve all Sudoku puzzles, and display the results on a graphic display. It will distinguish between a valid Sudoku solution, an incomplete but possibly solvable board, and a board (whether or not complete) that violates the rules of Sudoku. This will be done in two phases. In the first phase we implement constraint propagation to solve simple puzzles. In the second phase we will add back-tracking search to solve harder puzzles.
